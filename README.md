I used this to scrap information from switches. 
It was kinda working had weird issues. 
I decided to use netmiko because it's already implemented what i tried to do here. (Except from jump host)
Additionally there are ntc_templates which pretty much provide me parsing for any switch vendor
Yea just use python
